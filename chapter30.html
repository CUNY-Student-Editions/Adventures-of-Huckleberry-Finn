    <p class="pf">they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar, and
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tryin’ to give us the slip, was ye, you pup!  Tired of
      our company, hey?”
    </p>
    <p>
      I says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, your majesty, we warn’t—<span class="it">please</span> don’t,
      your majesty!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Quick, then, and tell us what <span class="it">was</span> your idea, or I’ll
      shake the insides out o’ you!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Honest, I’ll tell you everything just as it happened, your
      majesty.  The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept
      saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was
      sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by
      surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go
      of me and whispers, ‘Heel it now, or they’ll hang ye, sure!’ 
      and I lit out.  It didn’t seem no good for <span class="it">me</span> to stay—I
      couldn’t do nothing, and I didn’t want to be hung if I could
      get away.  So I never stopped running till I found the canoe; and
      when I got here I told Jim to hurry, or they’d catch me and hang me
      yet, and said I was afeard you and the duke wasn’t alive now, and I
      was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful glad when we see you
      coming; you may ask Jim if I didn’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, “Oh,
      yes, it’s <span class="it">mighty</span> likely!” and shook me up again, and
      said he reckoned he’d drownd me.  But the duke says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Leggo the boy, you old idiot!  Would <span class="it">you</span> a done any
      different?  Did you inquire around for <span class="it">him</span> when you got loose?
       I don’t remember it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it.
      But the duke says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “You better a blame’ sight give <span class="it">yourself</span> a good
      cussing, for you’re the one that’s entitled to it most.  You
      hain’t done a thing from the start that had any sense in it, except
      coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue-arrow mark.  That
      <span class="it">was</span> bright—it was right down bully; and it was the thing that
      saved us.  For if it hadn’t been for that they’d a jailed
      us till them Englishmen’s baggage come—and then—the
      penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took ’em to the graveyard, and
      the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the excited fools hadn’t
      let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we’d a slept in
      our cravats to-night—cravats warranted to <span class="it">wear</span>, too—longer
      than <span class="it">we’d</span> need ’em.”
    </p>
    <p>
      They was still a minute—thinking; then the king says, kind of
      absent-minded like:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mf!  And we reckoned the <span class="it">niggers</span> stole it!”
    </p>
    <p>
      That made me squirm!
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and
      sarcastic, “<span class="it">we</span> did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      After about a half a minute the king drawls out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Leastways, I did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke says, the same way:
    </p>
    <p>
      “On the contrary, I did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The king kind of ruffles up, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Looky here, Bilgewater, what’r you referrin’ to?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke says, pretty brisk:
    </p>
    <p>
      “When it comes to that, maybe you’ll let me ask, what was <span class="it">you</span>
      referring to?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shucks!” says the king, very sarcastic; “but I don’t
      know—maybe you was asleep, and didn’t know what you was about.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke bristles up now, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, let <span class="it">up</span> on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a
      blame’ fool? Don’t you reckon I know who hid that money in
      that coffin?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “<span class="it">Yes</span>, sir!  I know you <span class="it">do</span> know, because you done
      it yourself!”
    </p>
    <p><img class="one" alt="The duke went for him." src="c30-263.jpg"/>“It’s a lie!”—and the duke went for him.  The
      king sings out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Take y’r hands off!—leggo my throat!—I take it
      all back!”
    </p>
        <p>
      The duke says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, you just own up, first, that you <span class="it">did</span> hide that money
      there, intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and
      dig it up, and have it all to yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wait jest a minute, duke—answer me this one question, honest
      and fair; if you didn’t put the money there, say it, and I’ll
      b’lieve you, and take back everything I said.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You old scoundrel, I didn’t, and you know I didn’t.
       There, now!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, then, I b’lieve you.  But answer me only jest this
      one more—now <span class="it">don’t</span> git mad; didn’t you have it in
      your mind to hook the money and hide it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I don’t care if I <span class="it">did</span>, I didn’t <span class="it">do</span>
      it, anyway.  But you not only had it in mind to do it, but you <span class="it">done</span>
      it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that’s honest.
       I won’t say I warn’t goin’ to do it, because I <span class="it">was</span>;
      but you—I mean somebody—got in ahead o’ me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s a lie!  You done it, and you got to <span class="it">say</span> you
      done it, or—”
    </p>
    <p>
      The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:
    </p>
    <p>
      “’Nough!—I <span class="it">own up!</span>”
    </p>
    <p>
      I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier
      than what I was feeling before.  So the duke took his hands off and
      says:
    </p>
    <p>
      “If you ever deny it again I’ll drown you.  It’s <span class="it">well</span>
      for you to set there and blubber like a baby—it’s fitten for
      you, after the way you’ve acted. I never see such an old ostrich for
      wanting to gobble everything—and I a-trusting you all the time, like
      you was my own father.  You ought to been ashamed of yourself to
      stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never
      say a word for ’em.  It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was
      soft enough to <span class="it">believe</span> that rubbage.  Cuss you, I can see now
      why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit—you wanted to get
      what money I’d got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another, and
      scoop it <span class="it">all</span>!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn’t
      me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dry up!  I don’t want to hear no more out of you!”
      says the duke.  "And <span class="it">now</span> you see what you GOT by it.  They’ve
      got all their own money back, and all of <span class="it">ourn</span> but a shekel or two
      <span class="it">besides</span>.  G’long to bed, and don’t you deffersit
      <span class="it">me</span> no more deffersits, long ’s <span class="it">you</span> live!”
    </p>
    <p>
      So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,
      and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an
      hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the
      lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other’s arms.
       They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn’t
      get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the
      money-bag again.  That made me feel easy and satisfied.  Of
      course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim
      everything.
