    <hr/>
    <p><span class="sc">In</span> this book a number of dialects are used, to wit: the Missouri negro dialect; the extremest form of the backwoods South-Western dialect; the ordinary “Pike-County” dualect; and four modified varieties of this last. The shadings have not been done in a hap-hazard fashion, or by guess-work; but pains-takingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech.</p>
    <p>I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding.</p>
